Added walls, ramp to elevated platform

Red spheres are bombs which set your score (but not count) to zero (If you hit a bomb, you will still win after collecting 12 cubes, but your score will suffer).

Win the game by collecting all 12 of the cubes. Shoot for a high score!

Easter egg ramp (green one): You can roll off of this to get over the wall and access the lower area, 
which has 12 more available points, allowing for max score of 24 (You need a running start to make it, and
even then it can be tricky, but it is possible).

Changed player color to look like a marble
